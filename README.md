README for jamie branch. Aim: produce the text file contour as in Guil's sample. NB currently much easier to work with c++ on my own laptop as windows is annoying
(and no visual studio etc)


Initial thoughts: temika_header probably not needed for local work, not sure what 
the makefile and the shell script are for. It seems the `trackmovie` libs are used in `track_movie.cpp`

Will need to isolate modules from actual scripts that are running something, just as in the python case

Good chance to get back into c++!
